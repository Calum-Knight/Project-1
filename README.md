# Project-1

In this study, we are examining the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. 

This is done to draw comparisons and to understand the patterns that exist in the data. 

It also attempts to get a geographical representation of the COVID situation. The information provided would be relevant to the UK government for future planning.

The datasets were downloaded from: 

* https://www.kaggle.com/code/vascodegama/uk-covid-19-cases-deaths-vaccines-regions
* https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare
* https://developers.google.com/maps/

We analysed the number of daily cases reported, deaths reported and hospital admissions for the UK as a whole, and looked at what insights we could draw from these and the effects vaccination rollouts and national lockdowns had on these figures. 

We then also looked at analysing this at a regional level and comparing London to the rest of the UK. 

In addition to this, we created heatmaps for before the lockdown and after. 

The 2 null hypotheses we are testing:
1 - The booster vaccine has no effect on the number of deaths
2 - The population of a location has no effect on the number of cases recorded.
